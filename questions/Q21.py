"""
Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable
numbers.

For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The
proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, and 142; so d(284) = 220.

Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10,000.

# Loop through the numbers 1 to max_excl - 1:
#   Calculate the prime factor decomposition {prime: exponent} for each using the list of primes
#       (the line above is the part I am least sure about, not sure if there is a fast way of finding the decomposition)

#       product_{k}(sum_{i=0}^{exponent}(prime_{k}^i))
#       (i.e. the product of the sum of all the powers of each prime up to its exponent in the decomposition)
#       each sum can actually be simplified to:
#           sum_{i=0}^{exponent}(prime_{k}^i) = prime_{k}^{exponent + 1} / (p_{k} - 1)
#   So to get the sum of the proper divisors, just subtract the number from the sum.
